			<p>Videogames has probably been my biggest and most consistent hobby ever since my dad and brothers introduced me to it when I was little.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>JRPGs, In General</h2>
			<p>I mainly stick to games in this genre because they tend to have the type of gameplay and storylines I like best. The same goes for the graphics.</p>
		</div>		

		<div id="ff">
			<h2>FFXIV, FFXI</h2>
			<p>FFXI is an MMORPG like WoW where I've made some amazing friends that I've known for years, and some even for most of my life now. It's probably my most memorable game because of them. They're friends that taught me how to really look at myself and evaluate what kind of person I'd like to be and how to be more open minded. FFXIV is the game we moved to when FFXI was dying, and since then I've met many more people that have become important to me. </p>
			<p>Of course, I like the game's content as well. Completing the hardest content together is wonderful, and teaches me a lot about teamwork and communication.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="over">
			<h2>Overwatch</h2>
			<p>I never thought I'd get into a shooter game, but Blizzard has brought graphics (and slight backstory) more reminiscent to games JRPGs, and a more unique (sort of, since it's based off Team Fortress) system for shooters (in comparison to other popular ones, like Halo, Call of Duty, etc.) where each character has special abilities, like a class/job system. It's probably one of the only shooters I'll enjoy a lot, and it's great I can play it with my friends/family.</p>
